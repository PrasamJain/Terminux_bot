#TERMINUX BOT...

In this repo, we will take a look at building a robotic type Terminux bot in Android using JAVA. 

We have seen many apps and websites in which we will get to see a BOT where we can chat along with the chatbot and can easily get solutions for our 
questions answered from the Robotic bot.

TERMINUX BOT also a type of chat bot were we find a answere of our Question.

Later On we will update this BOT where the Terminux bot gives the output of your Linux Commands.
Likes - ls , cat "filename" , pwd ...etc

#ABOUT API -  Generating API key for using the bot service

Create a chatbot and interact with it through an open API. You can use the Terminux bot inside your messaging applications or to offer quick answers to your client's Questions.
Adding bots to an application or conversation plug-in allows people to ask questions, execute commands, etc. without interrupting what is being done.


*Why use an API in TERMINUX - BOT ?*

Imagine that Your application wants to access the data or functionality of another application. 
Maybe you are developing an application where you need quick information without having to go back or having to open another program. 
You simply make a call to your chatbot's API and you will get a text response without having to stop what you're doing.

*In this app. we use RetroFit API.* 

Retrofit is an awesome type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java built by awesome folks at Square. 
Retrofit makes it easy to consume JSON or XML data which is parsed into Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).

Note : For using RetroFit API - Donâ€™t forget to add INTERNET permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
